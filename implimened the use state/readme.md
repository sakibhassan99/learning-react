# just made my own small version of react

i made a small version of react where i made a render method and a react create Element method
it was hard for me since its my first time but i did it obviously i took some help from chatgpt and youtube

but im happy that i just finished it i learned many things while building this project that how react
works behind the scene 

# just implemented the useState hook

i just just implemented the useState hook but it doesn't provide the diffing algorithm & reconciliation
so it wont gonna work like react it will render the whole page on every state update
